          A credit card is more than a plastic or digital token. It is a contract, a revolving line of credit and a data connection into payment networks. This page explains the structure in neutral, documentation-style language — not recommendations or approval advice.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Card vs. Account vs. Network</h2>
      <p>In everyday language, “credit card” often refers to the physical card, the account and the payment network as if they were a single thing. In documentation, these are distinct components.</p>
      <p>
        A <strong>card account</strong> is a revolving credit line with its own number, terms and conditions.
        The <strong>card itself</strong> (physical or virtual) is a credential used to access that line.
        The <strong>network</strong> (for example a major scheme) provides the rails that connect issuers, merchants and acquirers.
      </p>
      <p>Understanding this separation makes it easier to read agreements, pricing tables and network rules without confusion.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>Key Elements of a Credit Card</h2>
      <p>Most credit-card products, regardless of branding, share a common set of structural elements. Documentation usually covers at least the following:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Credit limit</strong> – the maximum amount that can be outstanding at one time.</li>
        <li><strong>APR and pricing</strong> – interest rates, fees and the rules for when they apply.</li>
        <li><strong>Billing cycle</strong> – how often statements are issued and when payments are due.</li>
        <li><strong>Grace period</strong> – conditions under which purchases do not accrue interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction types</strong> – purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and fees.</li>
        <li><strong>Rewards and benefits</strong> – if included, how points, miles or cashback accumulate and can change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These building blocks define how the card behaves over time, even when marketing focuses on a few headline benefits.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>The Lifecycle of a Card Transaction</h2>
      <p>When you use a credit card, several steps occur in sequence:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>An authorization request is sent from the merchant, through the acquirer and network, to the issuer.</li>
        <li>The issuer checks available limit, risk signals and other rules before approving or declining.</li>
        <li>If approved, the transaction later settles and posts as a debit on your account.</li>
        <li>At the end of the cycle, the transaction appears on your statement with a due date.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additional rules apply if the transaction is refunded, disputed or adjusted, which is why statements and agreements devote sections to these scenarios.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>How a Credit Card Appears in Documentation</h2>
      <p>Different documents describe different aspects of the same product:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Cardholder agreement</strong> – core legal terms, rights and obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Pricing addendum</strong> – APR ranges, fees, FX margins and how they may change.</li>
        <li><strong>Rewards terms</strong> – earn rates, caps, expiration rules and devaluation clauses.</li>
        <li><strong>Benefit guides</strong> – protections, insurance and eligibility conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Network rules (high level)</strong> – dispute rights and acceptance rules.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Reading these together gives a more complete picture than marketing summaries alone.</p>
